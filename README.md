# Google Search Engine Battle

This is a game called "Google Search Engine Battle".

## Technical Details

I designed and developed this SPA using Angular, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to showcase in-depth knowledge of the MEAN stack and its various components.

For the front-end, I combined Angular, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, to design and implement the simple yet elegant UI/UX for the user and the logic to execute the game.

For the back-end, I utilized MEN of the MEAN stack, a REST API and Firebase to implement a dynamic server on AWS to host the application and support routing, authentication and data-retrieval.

Other Technologies Used: TypeScript, JavaScript.

## How can I try it?

The website is no longer live, so you will have to clone the repo and run it locally. You may have issues running it since it was built on old versions of all software being used (e.g. Angular, Node.js etc.)

Take a swing at the game and let me know how you like it!
