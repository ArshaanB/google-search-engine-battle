# Google Search Engine Battle

This is a game called "Google Search Engine Battle".

I designed and developed this SPA using Angular, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to showcase in-depth knowledge of the MEAN stack and its various components.

For the back-end, I utilized MEN of the MEAN stack with a REST API to implement a dynamic server on AWS to host the application and support routing, authentication and data-retrieval. 

For the front-end, I combined Angular, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, to design and implement the simple yet elegant UI/UX for the user and the logic to execute the game.

Other Technologies Used: TypeScript, JavaScript.
