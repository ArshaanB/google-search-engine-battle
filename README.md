# Google Search Engine Battle

This is a game called "Google Search Engine Battle", it was created using Angular. It is a SPA showcasing my in-depth knowledge of the framework (through usage of HTTP, Routing, Authentication, API Backend and Forms).

The live website is (http://searchenginebattle-env.uiqyfqqem2.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/). Take a swing at the game and let me know how you like it!
